# Introduction

In the next exercises you will find the steps to enable the scenario for SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Most of the steps are not so detailed and contain rather the links to the official documentation.

In this part of the tutorial it's assumed that you are going to create a new subaccount. If you have an existing one, check if something is missing and only then add it to the subaccount.

Additionally you can also check a blog post for [Event Mesh and SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Setup for SAP Build Process Automation](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/event-mesh-and-sap-s-4hana-public-cloud-setup-for-sap-build-process/ba-p/13791480).
