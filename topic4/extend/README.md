# Important Information

In this part of the tutorial you are going to see how to extend a standard business object **Purchase Order**. This extension includes a custom field (available for persistency and APIs), the UI extension and custom logic part to fill the initial data.

As the extensiblity process includes change, activation and locking of standard development objects, it is **not** possible to have this part as a hands-on exercise. So the script doesn't contain any step-by-step instruction, but provides rather reference screenshots to check the possiblities of Key User Extensibility.
