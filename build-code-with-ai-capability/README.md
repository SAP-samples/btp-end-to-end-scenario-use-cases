# Develop Full Stack BTP Applications powered by AI

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to jumpstart your application development of a full-stack SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)-based application.


# Business Scenario

In this hands-on exercise, you will build an application called Incident Management using SAP Build Code. The business scenario of the Incident Management application is the following:

ACME is a popular Electronics company. ACME hires call center support representatives to process and manage customer incidents. A call center support representative (Processor) receives a phone call from an existing customer and creates a new incident on behalf of the customer. The newly created incident is based on a customer complaint received during the phone call. The call center support representative also adds the conversation with the customer to the incident for future reference.
