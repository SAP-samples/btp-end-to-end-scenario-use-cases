2. Set the the link to the Cloud Foundry environment (use your CF API URL which you can find in the **Overview** section of your subbaccount):
 
  ```bash
     cf api https://api.cf.eu10-005.hana.ondemand.com
  ```
  Result:
  
  ```
    Setting API endpoint to https://api.cf.eu10-005.hana.ondemand.com...
    OK

    API endpoint:   https://api.cf.eu10-005.hana.ondemand.com
    API version:    3.186.0

    Not logged in. Use 'cf login' or 'cf login --sso' to log in.
  ```
  
  

3. Log in with your email user and origin of the workshop IAS. Then enter your password.

  ```
    cf login -u <your user> --origin pesworkshops-platform
  ```
  You should get an Authentication OK message.


### Build and Deploy
1. Go to File Explorer and call the popup menu for file **mta.yaml** in the application folder. Select **Build MTA Project** option.

> It may take several minutes. Please be patient.

> It may take several minutes. But you shouldn't wait until it's done and proceed to the following exercise.

3. The deployment is finished when you get a similar message:

~~~log
Application "author-readings-srv-{your id}" started and available at "{subaccount}-dev-author-readings-srv-ab123.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com"
~~~

## Result

The application has been deployed. You can now check the applications and services created for the app in the Cloud Foundry space.
