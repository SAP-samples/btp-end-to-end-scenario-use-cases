# Bill of Materials

In the full version of Poetry Slam Manager with multitenancy, SAP ERP integration, and additional features, the Partner Reference Application uses several subaccounts and entitlements. These subaccounts include a provider subaccount, where the application is deployed, and consumer subaccounts that contain customer-specific information and configuration. An overview is provided in the section below.

## Subaccounts

The example setup serves four sample customers: 
-	*Andina Publications*: A well-established publishing house using SAP S/4HANA Cloud enterprise projects to run poetry slam events.
-	*OEC computers*: A company whose employees frequently come together for poetry slams with a great buffet and all-you-can-eat mousse au chocolat. 
-	*Almika Events Cleveland*: An event agency that plans events using SAP Business ByDesign as their ERP solution.
-	*Invictus Live Events*: A small poet startup without any ERP solution yet (but a promising ERP prospect if they stay on their exciting growth journey).

To develop and run the application for these consumers, the following directory and subaccount structure is proposed.

On top of the mentioned entitlements, the connectivity and security services are part of the consumer accounts of the solution.

## Modules

### Running in Cloud Foundry
The application consists of the following modules which are deployed into the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime of the provider subaccount. 

Provided by SAP:
- Application Router                                                           
- Multitenancy Extension Module                                                  
- Service Broker     

Your main development task:                                            
- Partner Application Module  

### Node Modules
Some open-source node modules offered by SAP are used to build the solution. 

Provided by SAP:
- SAP Cloud Application Programming Model on Node.js 
- SAPUI5 with SAP Fiori elements 
- SAP Cloud SDK 

## Applications
SAP offers several applications to build the solution. These applications need to be downloaded and installed on the local machine.

Provided by SAP:
- Adobe LiveCycle Designer                                                 

# Scaling
To get an overview of how the services scale and how many entitlements you require for an application, here's an example based on the projected use of the Partner Reference Application.

Let's assume a typical data volume of two poetry slams per week (or 125 slams per year), with 200 visits per event. After three years, if you assume that one visitor books on average two different poetry slams, for 20 subscriptions (customers), this results in a volume of:
 - 7,500 poetry slam events
 - 750,000 visitors and artists
 - 1,500,000 bookings

> Note: The required quantities of most services are calculated based on memory, storage, or usage counts. The SAP HANA Cloud database is based on capacity units (CU), which consider several factors like memory, CPUs, and storage. You can use the [SAP HANA Cloud Capacity Unit Estimator](https://hcsizingestimator.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/) to calculate the capacity units required. The chapter [Estimating the Required Size of the SAP HANA Cloud Database](./27-Hana-DB-Scaling.md) explains how to calculate the required CUs based on the above business volume. Next to the SAP HANA Cloud database, resources for the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime need to be acquired. The chapter [Estimating the Required Cloud Foundry Environment Configuration](./28-CF-Environment-Scaling.md) provides guidance on determining the necessary GB of memory for your application. However, this requires measurements in a deployed and running (test) version of the application.

The table below shows how the required quantities scale with typical numbers of customers. The scaling is less than linear which is the benefit of resource sharing in multi-tenant application. This means the costs per customer significantly decrease the more customers you serve.
