# Integrate S/4HANA Cloud system with SAP BTP

In this section, you enhance Poetry Slam Manager, your SAP BTP solution, to make sure that it supports SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition as the back end. 

Front-end integration:
1. Navigate from Poetry Slam Manager to related SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition enterprise projects.

Back-channel integration:

2. Create SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition enterprise projects from Poetry Slam Manager and display SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition project information on the Poetry Slam Manager UI using OData APIs with principal propagation.

## How to Enhance the Application Step by Step

To explore the ERP integration with the Poetry Slam Manager, you have two options: 

1. Clone the repository of the Partner Reference Application. Check out the [*main-multi-tenant*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant) branch and enhance the application step by step. 

2. Alternatively, check out the [*main-multi-tenant-features*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features) branch where the ERP integration is already included. 

The following section describes how to enhance the **main-multi-tenant** branch (option 1).

## Consume SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition OData APIs

In this section, you learn how to import the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition OData service as a "remote service" into the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model project and how to use the OData service to create SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition enterprise projects to plan and run poetry slam events.

You keep the core of your multi-tenant application, which you developed in the previous tutorials, and add changes for the ERP integration. 

> Note: Your solution is now in a good state to save a version of your implementation in your version control system, which enables you to go back to the multi-tenant application without ERP integration at any time.

### Import SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition OData Services

You use the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition OData services for enterprise projects to read and write SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition projects in the context of a user interaction. The SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition OData services are available on SAP API Business Hub.

1. Download the metadata files (*.edmx* files) from the *API Specification* section:
    - [*Enterprise Project*](https://api.sap.com/api/API_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_SRV_0002/overview) (OData v2)
    - [*Enterprise Project - Read Project Processing Status*](https://api.sap.com/api/ENTPROJECTPROCESSINGSTATUS_0001/overview) (OData v4)
    - [*Enterprise Project - Read Project Profile*](https://api.sap.com/api/ENTPROJECTPROFILECODE_0001/overview) (OData v4)

2. Rename the metadata files (*.edmx* files) and add the prefix `S4HC_` to avoid naming conflicts:
    -  `S4HC_API_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_SRV_0002.edmx`
    -  `S4HC_ENTPROJECTPROCESSINGSTATUS_0001.edmx`
    -  `S4HC_ENTPROJECTPROFILECODE_0001.edmx`

3. In SAP Business Application Studio, to import the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition OData service into the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) project, create a folder with the name `external_resources` in the root folder of the application.

4. Open the context menu of the *external_resources* folder and upload the *.edmx* file with the OData services as remote services.

5. Open a terminal. Navigate to the root folder of the application, and import the remote service using the command:  

    `cds import ./external_resources/S4HC_API_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_SRV_0002.edmx --as cds` 

    Repeat the `cds import` command for the other two services:
    - `cds import ./external_resources/S4HC_ENTPROJECTPROCESSINGSTATUS_0001.edmx --as cds` 
    - `cds import ./external_resources/S4HC_ENTPROJECTPROFILECODE_0001.edmx --as cds` 

    As a result, the system creates CDS files in the folder *./srv/external* for all remote services and enhanced the file *package.json* with CDS configurations referring to the remote services.

    > Note: Don't use the CDS import command parameter `--keep-namespace` because it would lead to service name clashes if you import multiple SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition OData services.

6. Enhance the file [*package.json*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/package.json) with development configurations for local testing and productive configurations. Ensure that the flag *csrf* and *csrfInBatch* is set in the file *package.json* to enable the management of cross-site request forgery tokens (required for POST requests at runtime) using destinations of the type:

    ```json
    "cds": {
        "S4HC_API_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_SRV_0002": {
            "kind": "odata-v2",
            "model": "srv/external/S4HC_API_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_SRV_0002",
            "csrf": true,

                }
            },
            "[production]": {

                    "destination": "s4hc",
                    "path": "/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_SRV;v=0002"
                }
            }
        },
        "S4HC_ENTPROJECTPROCESSINGSTATUS_0001": {
            "kind": "odata",

                    "username": "{{test-user}}",
                    "password": "{{test-password}}"
                }
            },
            "[production]": {
                "credentials": {
                    "destination": "s4hc-tech-user",
                    "path": "/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_entprojprocessingstat/srvd_a2x/sap/entprojectprocessingstatus/0001"
                }
            }
        },
        "S4HC_ENTPROJECTPROFILECODE_0001": {
            "kind": "odata",
            "model": "srv/external/S4HC_ENTPROJECTPROFILECODE_0001",
            "csrf": true,
            "csrfInBatch": true,
            "[development]": {
                "credentials": {
                    "url": "https://{{S4HC-hostname}}/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_entprojectprofilecode/srvd_a2x/sap/entprojectprofilecode/0001",
                    "authentication": "BasicAuthentication",
                    "username": "{{test-user}}",
                    "password": "{{test-password}}"
                }
            },
            "[production]": {
                "credentials": {
                    "destination": "s4hc-tech-user",
                    "path": "/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_entprojectprofilecode/srvd_a2x/sap/entprojectprofilecode/0001"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    > Note: The *package.json* refers to the destinations *s4hc* and *s4hc-tech-user* that must be created in the consumer SAP BTP subaccount. The destination *s4hc* is used for remote service calls with principal propagation. See the next section for more details.

    > Note: For local testing, replace `{{S4HC-hostname}}`, `{{test-user}}`, and `{{test-password}}` with a system, user, and password from SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. However, don't push this information to your GitHub repository.

### Enhance the Entity Model to Store Key Project Information

In SAP Business Application Studio, enhance the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model entity models in the file [*/db/poetrySlamManagerModel.cds*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/db/poetrySlamManagerModel.cds) with elements to store project key information, which makes it possible to associate poetry slams with projects in the remote ERP systems.

1. Enhance the entity *PoetrySlams* with the following elements:
    ```javascript
    projectID       : String;
    projectObjectID : String;
    projectURL      : String;
    projectSystem   : String;  
    ```  

2. Enhance the annotations of entity *PoetrySlams* with the following elements:
    ```javascript
    projectID           @title: '{i18n>projectID}';         @readonly;
    projectObjectID     @title: '{i18n>projectObjectID}'    @readonly;
    projectURL          @title: '{i18n>projectURL}'         @readonly;
    projectSystem       @title: '{i18n>projectSystem}'      @readonly;
    ```  

3. Enhance the labels of the entity *PoetrySlams* in the file [*/db/i18n/i18n.properties*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/db/i18n/i18n.properties) with the labels: 
    ```javascript
    projectID               = Project
    projectObjectID         = Project UUID
    projectURL              = Project URL
    projectSystem           = System Type
    ```
     > In the reference example, the [*/db/i18n/i18n_de.properties*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/db/i18n/i18n_de.properties) file with the German texts is available too. You can take them over accordingly.

### Enhance the Service Model With the Remote Service

1. In SAP Business Application Studio, to extend the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model service model by remote entities, open the service models file [*srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamService.cds*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamService.cds).

2. Add a projection of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition project to the service model for consumption in the Fiori Elements UI:

    ```javascript
    // -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Extend service PoetrySlamService by SAP S/4HANA Cloud projects (principal propagation)

    using {S4HC_API_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_SRV_0002 as RemoteS4HCProject} from '../external/S4HC_API_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_SRV_0002';

    extend service PoetrySlamService with {
        entity S4HCProjects    as
            projection on RemoteS4HCProject.A_EnterpriseProject {
                key ProjectUUID           as projectUUID,
                    Project               as project,
                    ProjectDescription    as projectDescription,
                    ResponsibleCostCenter as responsibleCostCenter,
                    ProjectStartDate      as projectStartDate,
                    ProjectEndDate        as projectEndDate,
                    ProjectProfileCode    as projectProfileCode,
                    ProcessingStatus      as processingStatus,
            }
    };
    ```

3. Enhance the service model of service *PoetrySlamService* with virtual elements and an association to the remote project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud. The virtual elements are calculated, non-persisted fields to pass on the name of the ERP system from the destination to the UI, and the visualization of actions.

    ```javascript
    // Poetry Slams (draft enabled)
    @odata.draft.enabled
    @Common.SemanticObject: 'poetryslams'
    @Common.SemanticKey   : [ID]
    entity PoetrySlams as
        select from poetrySlamManagerModel.PoetrySlams {
            // Selects all fields of the PoetrySlams domain model
            *,
            maxVisitorsNumber - freeVisitorSeats as bookedSeats                  : Integer @title     : '{i18n>bookedSeats}',
            // Relevant for coloring of status in UI to show criticality
            virtual null                         as statusCriticality            : Integer @title     : '{i18n>statusCriticality}',
            virtual null                         as projectSystemName            : String  @title     : '{i18n>projectSystemName}'        @odata.Type: 'Edm.String',
            // SAP S/4HANA Cloud projects: visibility of button "Create Project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud", code texts
            virtual null                         as createS4HCProjectEnabled     : Boolean @odata.Type: 'Edm.Boolean',
            virtual null                         as projectProfileCodeText       : String  @title     : '{i18n>projectProfile}'           @odata.Type: 'Edm.String',
            virtual null                         as processingStatusText         : String  @title     : '{i18n>processingStatus}'         @odata.Type: 'Edm.String',
            virtual null                         as isS4HC                       : Boolean @odata.Type: 'Edm.Boolean',
            // Projection of remote service data as required by the UI
            toS4HCProject                                                        : Association to PoetrySlamService.S4HCProjects on toS4HCProject.project = $self.projectID
    }
    ```

4. Enhance the service model of service *PoetrySlamService* with an action to create remote projects:
    ```javascript
    // SAP S/4HANA Cloud projects: action to create a project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
    @(
        Common.SideEffects             : {TargetEntities: [
            '_poetryslam',
            '_poetryslam/toS4HCProject'
        ]},
        cds.odata.bindingparameter.name: '_poetryslam'
    )
        action createS4HCProject()     returns PoetrySlams;
    ```
    > Note: The side effect annotation refreshes the project data right after executing the action.

5. In case you want to support an option to clear the connection to the created project, enhance the service model of service *PoetrySlamService* with the action `clearProjectData`.
    ```javascript
    // ERP systems: action to clear the project data
      @(
        Common.SideEffects             : {TargetEntities: [
          '_poetryslam',
          '_poetryslam/toS4HCProject'
        ]},
        cds.odata.bindingparameter.name: '_poetryslam'
      )
      action clearProjectData();
    ```

### Enhance the Authentication Model to Cover Remote Projects

1. In SAP Business Application Studio, to extend the authorization annotation of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model service model by restrictions referring to the remote services, open the file [*srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamServiceAuthorizations.cds*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamServiceAuthorizations.cds) with the authorization annotations.

2. Enhance the authorization model for the service entities *S4HCProjects*, *S4HCEnterpriseProjectElement*, *S4HCEntProjTeamMember*, *S4HCEntProjEntitlement*, *S4HCProjectsProjectProfileCode*, *S4HCProjectsProcessingStatus*:
    ```javascript
    // SAP S/4HANA Cloud projects: Managers can read remote projects (creation is done using the remote service, not the projection in the PoetrySlamService)
    annotate PoetrySlamService.S4HCProjects with @(restrict: [{
        grant: ['READ'],
        to   : 'PoetrySlamFull'
    }]);
    ```

### Create Files with Reuse Functions for the ERP System Integration

You can define reuse functions that handle the connection for the different Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in separate files. 

1. Create a file to check and get the destinations in path */srv/poetryslam/util/destination.js*. 
2. Add the functions *readDestination*, *getDestinationURL*, and *getDestinationDescription* from the file [*/srv/poetryslam/util/destination.js*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/util/destination.js).

    > Note: The reuse functions *readDestination*, *getDestinationURL*, and *getDestinationDescription* read the destination from the subscriber subaccount. This system behavior is achieved by passing the JSON Web Token of the logged-in user to the function to get the destination. The JSON Web Token contains the tenant information.

    > Note: The reuse function *getDestinationDescription* returns the destination description from the SAP BTP consumer subaccount.

3. Since the npm module *@sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity* is used in the file *destination.js*, add the corresponding npm modules to your project. To do so, open a terminal and run the commands:

    i. `npm add @sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity` 

    ii. `npm add @sap-cloud-sdk/http-client`

    The dependencies are added to the *dependencies* section in the [*package.json*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/package.json) file. 

4. Create a new folder *connector* in path */srv/poetryslam*.
5. Create a file with the path */srv/poetryslam/connector/connector.js*. This file is reused for different ERP integrations.
6. Copy the ERP connection reuse functions in the file [*/srv/poetryslam/connector/connector.js*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/connector/connector.js) into your project. It delegates the OData requests and holds the destinations.
    
### Create a File with Reuse Functions for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition

Reuse functions specific to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition are defined in a separate file. 

1. Create a file with the path */srv/poetryslam/connector/connectorS4HC.js*. 
2. Copy the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition related functions in the file [*connectorS4HC.js*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/connector/connectorS4HC.js) into your project. The file contains functions to delegate OData requests to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, to read SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition project data, and to assemble an OData payload to create SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition projects.

    > Note: This file contains a function ```insertRemoteProjectData()```. This function creates a project purchase order in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition by creating an entity directly using the external imported service and the external entity model. It does *not* use the projection as modeled in the *PoetrySlamService*. This is intentional: The projection is used for fields shown in the Fiori Elements UI (read-only) or updates of individual fields. More complex write scenarios, including create scenarios, should directly call the external imported services. This avoids data type validations by CAP, leaving the validations to the external service. It also avoids a remodeling of all fields and compositions required for creation in the projection.

    > Note: This file contains sample data that can vary depending on the system. Check the data set and maintain it accordingly to ensure consistency between the Partner Reference App and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. The sample data is marked with a block comment *Project data for SAP S/4HANA Cloud; needs to be adopted according to SAP S/4HANA Cloud configuration*. For this tutorial, the *Responsible Cost Center* used in *connectorS4HC.js* is *10101101* and the *Company Code* is *1010*. 

### Enhance the Business Logic to Operate on SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Data

In SAP Business Application Studio, enhance the implementation of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model services to create and read SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition enterprise project data using the remote SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition OData service.

1. Delegate requests to the remote OData service. 
    1. Create a new file *srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamServiceERPImplementation.js* in your project. 

    2. Copy the following code snippet into the newly created file. As a reference you can have a look in the file [poetrySlamServiceERPImplementation.js](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamServiceERPImplementation.js) in the reference application.

        ```javascript
        'strict';

        // Add connector for project management systems
        const ConnectorS4HC = require('./connector/connectorS4HC');

        module.exports = async (srv) => {
            // -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            // Implementation of remote OData services (back-channel integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud)
            // -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            // Delegate OData requests to SAP S/4HANA Cloud remote project entities
            srv.on('READ', 'S4HCProjects', async (req) => {
                const connector = await ConnectorS4HC.createConnectorInstance(req);
                return await connector.delegateODataRequests(
                    req,
                    ConnectorS4HC.PROJECT_SERVICE
                );
            });
        }
        ```

        > Note: Without delegation, the remote entities return the error code 500 with the message: *SQLITE_ERROR: no such table* (local testing).

        > Note: In this example, the projection of the remote project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition as modeled in the PoetrySlamService is only used for *READ* access. In case you want to support *UPDATE* as well, you would need to change ```srv.on('READ', ...)``` to ```srv.on(['READ', 'UPDATE'], ...)``` in the above snippet. The *CREATE* is implemented separately as described in the previous section.

2. Enhance the [*/srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamServiceImplementation.js*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamServiceImplementation.js) to call the ERP implementation.

    1. Import the ERP forward handler.

        ```javascript
        const erpForwardHandler = require('./poetrySlamServiceERPImplementation');
        ```

    2. Call the ERP forward handler.

        ```javascript
        await erpForwardHandler(srv); // Forward handler to the ERP systems
        ```

3.  In the file [*/srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamServicePoetrySlamsImplementation.js*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/poetrySlamServicePoetrySlamsImplementation.js), the poetry slams entity is enriched with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition specific data. 

    1. Determine the connected back-end systems and read the project data from the remote system. Set the virtual element `createS4HCProjectEnabled` to control the visualization of the action to create the project dynamically and pass on the project system name.

        ```javascript
        // Expand poetry slams
        srv.on('READ', ['PoetrySlams.drafts', 'PoetrySlams'], async (req, next) => {
            // Read the PoetrySlams instances
            let poetrySlams = await next();

            // In this method we enrich the data from the database by external data and calculated fields
            // If none of these enriched fields are requested, we do not need to read from the external services
            // So we first check if the requested columns contain any of the enriched columns and return if not
            const requestedColumns = req.query.SELECT.columns?.map((item) =>
                Array.isArray(item.ref) ? item.ref[0] : item.as
            );
            const enrichedFields = [
                'projectSystemName',
                'processingStatusText',
                'projectProfileCodeText',
                'createS4HCProjectEnabled',
                'isS4HC',
                'toS4HCProject'
            ];

            if (
                requestedColumns &&
                !enrichedFields.some((item) => requestedColumns?.includes(item))
            ) {
                return poetrySlams;
            }

            // SAP S/4HANA Cloud
            // Check and read SAP S/4HANA Cloud project related data
            const connectorS4HC = await ConnectorS4HC.createConnectorInstance(req);
            if (connectorS4HC?.isConnected()) {
                poetrySlams = await connectorS4HC.readProject(poetrySlams);
            }

            for (const poetrySlam of convertToArray(poetrySlams)) {
                [
                    'projectSystemName',
                    'processingStatusText',
                    'projectProfileCodeText'
                ].forEach((item) => {
                    poetrySlam[item] = poetrySlam[item] || '';
                });

                // Update project system name and visibility of the "Create Project"-buttons
                if (poetrySlam.projectID) {
                    const systemNames = {
                        S4HC: connectorS4HC.getSystemName()
                    };
                    poetrySlam.createS4HCProjectEnabled = false;
                    poetrySlam.projectSystemName = systemNames[poetrySlam.projectSystem];
                } else {
                    poetrySlam.createS4HCProjectEnabled = connectorS4HC.isConnected();
                }

                // Update the backend system connected indicator used in UI for controlling visibility of UI elements
                poetrySlam.isS4HC = connectorS4HC.isConnected();
            }

            // Return remote data
            return poetrySlams;
        });
        ```

    > Note: The destinations called *s4hc* and *s4hc-url* connect to the ERP system. You create the destinations later on in the consumer subaccount in SAP BTP.

    2. Add the implementation of the action *createS4HCProjectEnabled*:

        1. Add the method to handle the *createS4HCProject* action.

            ```javascript
            //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
            // Implementation of entity events (entity PoetrySlams)
            // with impact on remote services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud
            // --------------------------------------------------------------------------

            // Entity action: Create SAP S/4HANA Cloud Enterprise Project
            srv.on('createS4HCProject', async (req) => {
                await createProject(
                    req,
                    srv,
                    ConnectorS4HC,
                    'ACTION_CREATE_PROJECT_NO_S4_HANA_CLOUD_SYSTEM'
                );
            });
            ```

        2. Add the import of the connector at the beginning of the file:

            ```javascript
            const ConnectorS4HC = require('./connector/connectorS4HC');
            ```

        3. Import the `createProject`-function from the `entityCalculations`.

            ```javascript
            const {
                calculatePoetrySlamData,
                updatePoetrySlam,
                convertToArray,
                createProject
            } = require('./util/entityCalculations');
            ```   

    3. Copy the implementation of the action `clearProjectData` to clear all project data:
        ```javascript
        srv.on('clearProjectData', async (req) => {
            ...
        });
        ```

4. Copy the constant `DATE_DAYS_MULTIPLIER` and the functions `createProject` and `subtractDaysFormatRFC3339` from the file [*/srv/poetryslam/util/entityCalculations.js*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/poetryslam/util/entityCalculations.js) into the implementation and export the functions at the end of the file.

5. Add the system message to the file [*/srv/i18n/messages.properties*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/i18n/messages.properties).

    > In the reference example, the [*/srv/i18n/messages_de.properties*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/i18n/messages_de.properties) file with the German texts is available too. You can take them over accordingly.

    ```javascript
    ACTION_CREATE_PROJECT_DRAFT                             = Projects cannot be created for draft Poetry Slams.
    ACTION_CREATE_PROJECT_NO_S4_HANA_CLOUD_SYSTEM           = No SAP S/4HANA Cloud system connected. Project cannot be created.
    ACTION_CREATE_PROJECT_FAILED                            = Project creation failed. Poetry Slam {0} was not updated.
    ACTION_READ_PROJECT_CONNECTION                          = Project cannot be retrieved.
    ACTION_ERP_REMOVED                                      = The ERP information was removed from poetry slam {0}.
    ```

### Enhance the Web App to Display SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Data 

1. Adopt the SAP Fiori elements annotations of the web app in the file [*/app/poetryslams/annotations.cds*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/app/poetryslams/annotations.cds).
    
    1. Add project annotations to the PoetrySlams entity.
        ```javascript
        projectObjectID              @UI.Hidden;
        createS4HCProjectEnabled     @UI.Hidden;
        isS4HC                       @UI.Hidden;
        ```

    2. Add a facet *Project Data* to display information from the remote service by following the *toS4HCProject* association:

        1. Add facet:
            ```javascript
            {
                $Type        : 'UI.ReferenceFacet',
                Label        : '{i18n>projectData}',
                ID           : 'ProjectData',
                Target       : @UI.FieldGroup #ProjectData,
                ![@UI.Hidden]: {$edmJson: {$Not: {$Path: 'isS4HC'}}} // Display ProjectData only in case a SAP S/4HANA Cloud system is connected
            },
            ```

        2. Add a field group *#ProjectData* with the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition project-specific fields:       
            ```javascript
            FieldGroup #ProjectData       : {Data: [
                // Project system independend fields:
                {
                    $Type: 'UI.DataFieldWithUrl',
                    Value: projectID,
                    Url  : projectURL
                },
                {
                    $Type: 'UI.DataField',
                    Value: projectSystemName
                },
                {
                    $Type: 'UI.DataField',
                    Value: projectSystem
                },
                // SAP S/4HANA Cloud specific fields
                {
                    $Type                  : 'UI.DataField',
                    Label                  : '{i18n>projectDescription}',
                    Value                  : toS4HCProject.projectDescription,
                    ![@UI.Hidden]          : {$edmJson: {$Not: {$Path: 'isS4HC'}}},
                    ![@Common.FieldControl]: #ReadOnly
                },
                {
                    $Type                  : 'UI.DataField',
                    Label                  : '{i18n>projectProfile}',
                    Value                  : projectProfileCodeText,
                    ![@UI.Hidden]          : {$edmJson: {$Not: {$Path: 'isS4HC'}}},
                    ![@Common.FieldControl]: #ReadOnly
                },
                {
                    $Type                  : 'UI.DataField',
                    Label                  : '{i18n>responsibleCostCenter}',
                    Value                  : toS4HCProject.responsibleCostCenter,
                    ![@UI.Hidden]          : {$edmJson: {$Not: {$Path: 'isS4HC'}}},
                    ![@Common.FieldControl]: #ReadOnly
                },
                {
                    $Type                  : 'UI.DataField',
                    Label                  : '{i18n>processingStatus}',
                    Value                  : processingStatusText,
                    ![@UI.Hidden]          : {$edmJson: {$Not: {$Path: 'isS4HC'}}},
                    ![@Common.FieldControl]: #ReadOnly
                },
                {
                    $Type                  : 'UI.DataField',
                    Label                  : '{i18n>projectStartDateTime}',
                    Value                  : toS4HCProject.projectStartDate,
                    ![@UI.Hidden]          : {$edmJson: {$Not: {$Path: 'isS4HC'}}},
                    ![@Common.FieldControl]: #ReadOnly
                },
                {
                    $Type                  : 'UI.DataField',
                    Label                  : '{i18n>projectEndDateTime}',
                    Value                  : toS4HCProject.projectEndDate,
                    ![@UI.Hidden]          : {$edmJson: {$Not: {$Path: 'isS4HC'}}},
                    ![@Common.FieldControl]: #ReadOnly
                }
            ]}
            ```

    3. Extend the list page with a link to the project:
        ```javascript
        // Definition of fields shown on the list page / table
        LineItem                      : [
            ...,
            {
                $Type: 'UI.DataFieldWithUrl',
                Value: projectID,
                Url  : projectURL
            }
        ]
        ```

    4. Add two buttons to the identification area:
        ```javascript
        // Create a project in the connected SAP S/4HANA Cloud system
        {
            $Type        : 'UI.DataFieldForAction',
            Label        : '{i18n>createS4HCProject}',
            Action       : 'PoetrySlamService.createS4HCProject',
            ![@UI.Hidden]: {$edmJson: {$Not: {$And: [
                {$Path: 'createS4HCProjectEnabled'},
                {$Path: 'IsActiveEntity'}
            ]}}}
        },
         // Clear the project data
        {
            $Type        : 'UI.DataFieldForAction',
            Label        : '{i18n>removeProjectData}',
            Action       : 'PoetrySlamService.clearProjectData',
            ![@UI.Hidden]: {$edmJson: {$Or: [
            {$Eq: [
                {$Path: 'projectID'},
                {$Null: null}
            ]},
            {$Not: {$Path: 'IsActiveEntity'}}
            ]}}
        }
        ```
        > Note: You dynamically control the visibility of the *Create Project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud* button based on the value of the *createS4HCProjectEnabled* transient field.    

4. In the *srv* folder, edit language-dependent labels in the file [*/srv/i18n/i18n.properties*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/i18n/i18n.properties). Add labels for project fields and the button to create projects:
    ```
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Transient Service Elements

    projectSystemName       = System Name

    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Service Actions

    createS4HCProject       = Create Project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
    removeProjectData       = Clear Project Data

    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Remote Project Elements

    projectTypeCodeText     = Project Type
    projectStatusCodeText   = Project Status
    projectCostCenter       = Cost Center
    projectStartDateTime    = Start Date
    projectEndDateTime      = End Date
    projectDescription      = Project Description
    projectProfile          = Project Profile
    responsibleCostCenter   = Responsible Cost Center
    processingStatus        = Processing Status
    ```        

    > In the reference example, the [*/srv/i18n/i18n_de.properties*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/srv/i18n/i18n_de.properties) file with the German texts is available too. You can take them over accordingly.

5. In the web app folder, edit language-dependent labels in the file [*app/poetryslams/i18n/i18n.properties*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/app/poetryslams/i18n/i18n.properties). Add a label for facet project data:

    ```
    projectData             = Project Data
    ``` 

    > In the reference example, the [*app/poetryslams/i18n/i18n_de.properties*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/app/poetryslams/i18n/i18n_de.properties) file with the German texts is available too. You can take them over accordingly.

### Test Locally

1. The *Create Project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud* button is dependent on the setup of the destinations. Once the destinations are correctly configured and the application is deployed to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime, the *Create Project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud* button will be active. To test this button locally, in _connectorS4HC.js_, method _createConnectorInstance_, change the value of **connector.isConnectedIndicator** to **true** after the connector instance is created:

    ```javascript
    const connector = new ConnectorS4HC(data);
    connector.isConnectedIndicator = true;
    ```

    > Note: This change is required as the *isConnectedIndicator* value is dependent on the setup of destinations. Destinations only work on a deployed application and cannot be tested locally.

2. Open a terminal and start the app with the development profile using the run command `cds watch --profile development`. 

3. Use the test users as listed in the file [*.cdsrc.json*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features/.cdsrc.json). 

4. Test the service endpoints *S4HCProjects*, *S4HCEnterpriseProjectElement*, *S4HCEntProjTeamMember*, *S4HCEntProjEntitlement*, *S4HCProjectsProcessingStatus*, and *S4HCProjectsProjectProfileCode* to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. The system returns the respective data from SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.
    
5. Open the */poetryslams/webapp* web application and open one of the poetry slams. 

6. Choose *Create Project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud*. The system creates a project in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition and displays the details in the *Project Details* section.
    > Note: The link to the project won't work in a local application. To test the full integration, including navigation to the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, you will have to test with the deployed application.

7. Test the *Service Endpoints* for *PoetrySlams* and note down the ID of the poetry slam for which you created the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition project in step 2 as **poetry-slam-ID**.

8. Append `(ID={{poetry-slam-ID}},IsActiveEntity=true)` to the service endpoint URL, replace the place holder *{{poetry-slam-ID}}* with the **poetry-slam-ID**, and run it again.

9. The system returns the record with the project ID and the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition project details as sub-node.

### Deploy the Application

Update your application in the provider subaccount. For detailed instructions, refer to the section [Deploy the Multi-Tenant Application to a Provider Subaccount](./24-Multi-Tenancy-Deployment.md).

> Note: Make sure any local changes have been reverted before deployment.

You have now successfully deployed the application to the provider subaccount and you're ready to [provision tenants of the multi-tenant application to customers and connect with SAP S/4HANA Cloud](./34b-Multi-Tenancy-Provisioning-Connect-S4HC.md).
