The  change tracking is implemented using [@cap-js/change-tracking](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cap-js/change-tracking) package.  `@cap-js/change-tracking` is a [CDS plugin](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-plugins#cds-plugin-packages) providing out-of-the box support for automatic capturing, storing, and viewing of the change records of the modeled entities.
