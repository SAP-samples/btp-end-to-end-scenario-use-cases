### For Code Lovers: Uncover the Quick Account Setup
If you're curious to see the code behind this automated setup, you can access the underlying Terraform scripts on GitHub.
These Terraform scripts can be used to do Infrastructure-as-Code on SAP BTP. You can see all details of the setup, adjust it to your needs, and create the resources on SAP BTP manually yourself.
