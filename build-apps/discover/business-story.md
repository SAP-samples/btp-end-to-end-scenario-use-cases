# The Mission Story

As a sample scenario, Jane a sales executive of ACME Corporation regularly meets different customers. She needs access to latest customer information on the go. She needs a simplified web application, which can run on a portable device like smartphone or a tablet.

ACME Corporation implements the application as an SAP S/4HANA extension on SAP BTP. This application is created with SAP Build Apps, a no-code user interface development tool.


This scenario covers:

* Building application with SAP Build Apps
* Set up connectivity between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Cloud or SAP S/4HANA on-premise 
* Deploying the application on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment

If you don't have an SAP S/4HANA system, you have the option to choose a mock server instead.
