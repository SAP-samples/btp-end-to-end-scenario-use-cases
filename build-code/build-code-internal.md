# Simplifying App Development with SAP Build Code powered by SAP Joule AI

In this hands-on exercise you would learn how to jumpstart your application development of a full stack SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) based application using SAP Build Code powered by Joule AI

## Key Capabilities of SAP Build Code

- Enables developers to code faster and smarter, generates code from natural language descriptions using generative AI.
- Builds extension applications, and integrates them with SAP and non-SAP systems.

# Business Scenario

In this hands-on exercise, you will build an application called Incident Management using SAP Build Code. The business scenario of the Incident Management application is the following:

ACME is a popular Electronics company. ACME hires call center support representatives to process and manage customer incidents. A call center support representative (Processor) receives a phone call from an existing customer and creates a new incident on behalf of the customer. The newly created incident is based on a customer complaint received during the phone call. The call center support representative also adds the conversation with the customer to the incident for future reference.
