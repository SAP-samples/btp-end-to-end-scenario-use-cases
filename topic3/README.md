# Clean Core Full Stack Application Development with SAP BTP

## Overview

Welcome to this guidance for application development on **SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)** following the **SAP BTP Developer Guide**. In the following documentation and tutorials, we provide information and examples on how to develop and deploy a full stack application based on **SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)** and **SAP Fiori elements** on SAP BTP using different tools and services.
