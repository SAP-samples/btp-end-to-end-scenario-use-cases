# Integration setup for 3rd Party Food Provider

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will implement an integration with a fictional catering company called BiteRight. Since we donâ€™t want to rely on real services, we will use a simple mock application instead. The sample API documentation for BiteRight can be found [here](./BiteRightAPI.md).

## Content

1. Go to your *Assets folder* and open file `manifest.yml` in any text editor. Change the application name by adding some unique prefix (for example, **catering-sample-ABC12345**). It's necessary as the application name is used to generate the application route, which should be unique for every Cloud Foundry organization.
